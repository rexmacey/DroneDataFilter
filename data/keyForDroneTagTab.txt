UIDs should be 21 characters.  Some of The UIDs in the tag file are not.  Starting with the UIDs that are too short,  if we find one and only
UID in the main data file whose first n characters match the short tag UID (where n is the length of the short tag UID),  we assume the short UID should 
be the UID found in the main data file.  For long UIDs (> 21 characters) in tag file, if we can find one and only UID in the main data file whose 21 
characters match the first 21 characters of a long tag UID then we assume the first 21 characters of the tag file's UID should be the UID
in the main data file.

Duplicate UIDs can be explained by reusing chips (tags).
