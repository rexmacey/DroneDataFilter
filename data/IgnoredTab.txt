All data in all the CSVs are read.  Observations are ignored for a variety of reasons: 
* Timestamp.UTC, UID or ReaderID is NA - records don't have useful data    
* Duplicates - Because some CSV files were copied    
* March 2021 - I have removed observations with time stamps with 2021-03. This is different from removing CSV files with 2021-03 in their name.    
* Test chips - Remove data related to the following UIDs (chopstick data).
